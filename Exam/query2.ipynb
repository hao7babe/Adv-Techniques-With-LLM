    "Desired Response: Diagnosis: Sepsis, Probability: 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "**Recommendation: Few-shot Learning**\n",
    "- Few-shot learning is more effective because it allows you to provide examples in the desired format. By giving a few examples structured as `Diagnosis: [Condition], Probability: [Value]%`, the LLM can learn to mimic the format consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages over Chain of Thoughts:\n",
    "- Chain of Thoughts is better suited for guiding the reasoning process, not for changing output formats.\n",
    "- Few-shot learning directly trains the LLM on the specific output structure desired."

    "### Answer\n",
    "**Recommendation: Instruction Prompting**\n",
    "- Instruction prompting is more effective in this case as it provides explicit, step-by-step guidance on how to perform the task. This ensures the LLM follows a precise logic to count occurrences of \"p.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages over Few-shot Learning:\n",
    "- Few-shot learning relies on examples to generalize, but it may still fail for edge cases or variations not covered in the examples.\n",
